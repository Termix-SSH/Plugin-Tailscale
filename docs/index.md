Tailscale connects Termix to your [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) tailnet. Add tailnet devices as hosts in a couple of clicks, and connect to them with Tailscale SSH so no passwords or keys are stored in Termix. It works with [Headscale](https://headscale.net/) too.

Termix's server needs to be on the tailnet to reach those devices.

## List your devices

1. Make an API key in the [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys), or with `headscale apikeys create` for Headscale.
2. Install the plugin from the **Plugins** tab.
3. Open **Settings**, **Tailscale** and paste the **API key**. For Headscale, also set **API base URL** to your Headscale server.
4. Press **Check** to see how many devices it can reach.

Open the **Tailscale** panel from the sidebar to see your devices. **Add host** adds one as a host, and **Copy Tailscale IP** copies its `100.x` address. In the host editor, **Select Tailscale device** fills in a device's address.

The key is stored encrypted. It is only used to list devices.

## Tailscale SSH

If a host runs [Tailscale SSH](https://tailscale.com/kb/1193/tailscale-ssh), Termix can connect with no credentials at all. Tailscale checks who you are and whether your tailnet's ACL allows it.

1. On the host, turn on Tailscale SSH: `tailscale set --ssh`.
2. In Termix, set the host's **Authentication Method** to **Tailscale**.
3. Set the username to a Unix user your tailnet's SSH ACL lets you use. It doesn't have to be root.

If your ACL has `check` mode on, Termix asks you to sign in to Tailscale in the browser before it connects.

## In Host Metrics

With [Host Metrics](/plugins/host-metrics) on, hosts get a **Tailscale** card: whether Tailscale runs, its IPs, peers and status. Save the host's sudo password to allow changes from the card.

## Troubleshooting

- **Tailscale SSH fails.** Check Tailscale runs on the host, SSH is turned on with `tailscale set --ssh`, and your ACL allows the connection from the Termix server's tailnet identity.
- **No devices.** Check the API key, and the base URL for Headscale.

Who can see the device list is set by `tailscale.devices.view`. Only admins have it at first.
